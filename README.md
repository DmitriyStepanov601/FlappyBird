# FlappyBird

This application is an interpretation of the famous game Flappy Bird.
The goal of this game is to control the flight of a bird that continuously moves between rows of green pipes. When you collide with them, the game ends. Control is performed by pressing the "space" key, in which the bird makes a small leap up. In the absence of jerks, the bird falls due to gravity, and the game also ends. Points are scored for each successful flight between two pipes. The gameplay has no changes throughout the game.
